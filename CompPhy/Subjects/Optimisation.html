    <h1 class="subHeadline">General Optimisation</h1>
    <p> Let's look at the different methods of optimization we have worked with in the course:
    <br>
    We have worked with Metropolis Monte Carlo search, Random Structure Search, Basin Hopping, Particle Swarm Optimization, Gradient-Based Local Optimization, and Line Search

        <h1>Metropolis Monte Carlo </h1>
        <br>

        <p>First off, we have the Metropolis Monte Carlo Method. The method utilizes a random walker to explore the energy landscape of a system.
        The path of the walker is determined by the Metropolis-Hastings criterion, which evaluates the energy of the system before and after each step and determines whether or not a step should be taken
        The acceptance is calculated as</p>
        <p style="text-align: center;">

        $\textbf{RND} < \min(1, \exp(-\Delta E /k_BT))$</p>

        <p>That is, always take a step when the energy becomes lower (The exponential is larger than 1), but take a step towards a higher energy based on a random number and the given temperature.
        Note that higher temperatures lead to the exponential being closer to 1 and thus a higher probability. This is shown in Figure 1.
        </p>

        <p class="imgText">Figure 1: Animation showcasing the effect of "Monte Carlo Temperature", denoted by kT.</p>
        

        <p>Note how the low temperature is very likely to be stuck in local minima, as the probability of taking a step towards a higher energy is very low. On the contrary, the high temperature case has a hard time converging to a minimum as the probability of leaving it is quite high.</p>

        <p>In Figures 3 and 4, the convergence of the Monte Carlo Method at different temperatures have been explored. There is a large number of walkers who converge very quickly, but these can simply be attributed to walkers that were initialised close the global minimum.
            The success rate of this method was highest for the high temperature case, which is expected as we already knew when the global minimum was reached and the temperature was high enough to allow for exploration of the energy landscape.

    <p>In the course, we have worked a lot with optimising molecules. It is very obvious, that we should look further into, what goes into this.</p>

        <h1>Velocity Verlet</h1>
        <br>

        
    
        <p>Velocity Verlet is a numerical method of simulating a system with constant energy. It's a method which incorporates the position and velocity equations up to second order:
        
        </p>
        <eq>
        $$x(t + \Delta t) = x(t) + v(t)\Delta t + \frac{1}{2}a(t)\Delta t^2$$
        
        $$v(t + \Delta t) = v(t) + \frac{1}{2}(a(t) + a(t + \Delta t))\Delta t$$
        </eq>

        <p>
        This form makes it easy to update positions and velocities of a large number of particles. The only requirement is to calculate the acceleration at each time step, which we can obtain from the gradient of the energy:
        </p>

        <eq>
        $$a = \frac{F}{m} = -\frac{\nabla E}{m}$$
        </eq>

        <p>
        The force can be calculated from the potential energy, which is a function of the distance between particles. The Lennard-Jones potential is a common choice for this purpose:
        </p>
        <eq>

        $$V(r) = 4\epsilon\left[\left(\frac{\sigma}{r}\right)^{12} - \left(\frac{\sigma}{r}\right)^6\right]$$
        </eq>
        <p>
        To do this with many particles, we calculate the force matrix, which is a symmetric matrix with the forces between all pairs of particles. The force between two particles is given by the gradient of the potential energy:
        </p>
        <eq>
        $$F_{ij} = F_{ji} = -\nabla V(r_{ij})$$
        </eq>
        <p>
        where </p><eq>$$r_{ij} = |r_i - r_j|$$</eq> <p>is the distance between particles i and j.

        <h1>Thermostat</h1>

        <p>
            To make our molecule simulation more accurate, we can introduce a thermostat, effectively introducing kinetic energy to the system as it's described in Statistical Mechanics. Here, the velocites are drawn from a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution, which is a Gaussian distribution with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 
        </p>
        <eq>$$ \sigma = \sqrt{\frac{kT}{m}}$$</eq>    
        

        <p>This is an approximation, which works fine as long as we are dealing with a low number of particles in a few dimensions.
            <br>
            Simulating the thermostat is done by setting the velocities at fixed intervals from the above-mentioned distribution and then using the Velocity Verlet method to .

        <h1>Exploration of potentials</h1>

        <p>
            In Figure 3, a potential is being sampled using molecular dynamics, that is, sampling using both a thermostat and the Velocity Verlet method. As is readily apparent, the low-energy molecules tend to stay constrained within their own local minimum, where the higher temperature molecules are more likely to spread out.

    <h1 class="subHeadline">Using PyTorch</h1>
    <p>PyTorch is a powerful tool for optimisation, as it allows for automatic differentiation. 
        This means that we can calculate the gradient of a function without having to do it manually. 
        This is very useful when we are working with a large number of particles, as the gradient can be quite complex, but PyTorch can handle it.

        <h1>Optimising Molecules, the Easy Way™</i></h1>

        <p>Because auto-differentiation doesn't require us to know the analytic derivative of our potentials, we know have a much easier time getting the forces out. This allows us a much more hassle-free experience.</p>
