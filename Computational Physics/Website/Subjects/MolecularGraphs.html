    <h1>Molecular Graphs</h1>
    <p> Here are some thoughts on Molecular Graphs:

    Let's examine:

        <br>

        <p>Graph Neural Networks are a type of neural network that can be used to represent and understand data that is in the form of a graph. 
            This is a very powerful tool, as many systems can be represented as graphs, such as social networks, molecular structures, and many more.
            We describe a graph by providing a set of nodes and edges, where the edges represent the connections between the nodes. 
            It is possible for systems to have edges only in <strong>one direction</strong>, <strong>both directions</strong> and even <strong>self-connections</strong> (self-loops).

        <br>

        <p>There is only a certain number of ways to arrange graphs, and we can easily quantify this. 
            By using the adjacency matrix $A$, whose element $A_{ab}$ is the connection from node a to node b, we have a way to distinguish between graphs that is independent of the positions of each node.
        The adjacency matrix is of course diagonal for graphs that only have bi-directional edges</p>

        <h1 style="font-size: xx-large;">Aggregation</h1>

        To understand how to use Graph Neural Networks, we need to understand how they work. Each node has some sort of feature given either by a vector or a scalar.
