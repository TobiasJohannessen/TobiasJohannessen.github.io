    <h1>Week 3: Global Optimisation</h1>
    <p> Here are some thoughts on the exercises from Week 3:
    <br>
    This week's exercises are about different methods of optimization, both local and global. 
    We have worked with Metropolis Monte Carlo search, Random Structure Search, Basin Hopping, Particle Swarm Optimization, Gradient-Based Local Optimization, and Line Search
    <br>
    <br>   
    Let's examine:

        <h1>Metropolis Monte Carlo </h1>
        <br>

        <p>First off, we have the Metropolis Monte Carlo Method. The method utilizes a random walker to explore the energy landscape of a system.
        The path of the walker is determined by the Metropolis-Hastings criterion, which evaluates the energy of the system before and after each step and determines whether or not a step should be taken
        The acceptance is calculated as</p>
        <eq>

        $$\textbf{RND} < \min(1, \exp(-\Delta E /k_BT))$$</eq>

        <p>That is, always take a step when the energy becomes lower (The exponential is larger than 1), but take a step towards a higher energy based on a random number and the given temperature.
        Note that higher temperatures lead to the exponential being closer to 1 and thus a higher probability. This is shown in Figure 1.

        <p>Note how the low temperature is very likely to be stuck in local minima, as the probability of taking a step towards a higher energy is very low. On the contrary, the high temperature case has a hard time converging to a minimum as the probability of leaving it is quite high.</p>

Five temperatures have been used and for each of the temperatures, 1000 walkers were simulated. The box to the right are the walkers who didn't converge after 5000 steps.</p>

        <p>In Figures 3 and 4, the convergence of the Monte Carlo Method at different temperatures have been explored. There is a large number of walkers who converge very quickly, but these can simply be attributed to walkers that were initialised close the global minimum.
            The success rate of this method was highest for the high temperature case, which is expected as we already knew when the global minimum was reached and the temperature was high enough to allow for exploration of the energy landscape.
