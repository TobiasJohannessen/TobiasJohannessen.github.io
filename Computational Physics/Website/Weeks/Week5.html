    <h1>Week 5: Molecular Dynamics</h1>
    <p> Here are some thoughts on the exercises from Week 5:<br>
        This week is about simulating Molecular Dynamics using both potential and kinetic energy of atoms.

        <h1>Velocity Verlet</h1>
        <br>

        
    
        <p>Velocity Verlet is a numerical method of simulating a system with constant energy. It's a method, which incorporates the position and velocity equations up to second order:
        
        </p>
        <eq>
        $$x(t + \Delta t) = x(t) + v(t)\Delta t + \frac{1}{2}a(t)\Delta t^2$$
        
        $$v(t + \Delta t) = v(t) + \frac{1}{2}(a(t) + a(t + \Delta t))\Delta t$$
        </eq>

        <p>
        This form makes it easy to update positions and velocities of a large number of particles. The only requirement is to calculate the acceleration at each time step, which we can obtain from the gradient of the energy:
        </p>

        <eq>
        $$a = \frac{F}{m} = -\frac{\nabla E}{m}$$
        </eq>

        <p>
        The force can be calculated from the potential energy, which is a function of the distance between particles. The Lennard-Jones potential is a common choice for this purpose:
        </p>
        <eq>

        $$V(r) = 4\epsilon\left[\left(\frac{\sigma}{r}\right)^{12} - \left(\frac{\sigma}{r}\right)^6\right]$$
        </eq>
        <p>
        To do this with many particles, we calculate the force matrix, which is a symmetric matrix with the forces between all pairs of particles. The force between two particles is given by the gradient of the potential energy:
        </p>
        <eq>
        $$F_{ij} = F_{ji} = -\nabla V(r_{ij})$$
        </eq>
        <p>
        where </p><eq>$$r_{ij} = |r_i - r_j|$$</eq> <p>is the distance between particles i and j.

        <h1>Thermostat</h1>

        <p>
            To make our molecule simulation more accurate, we can introduce a thermostat, effectively introducing kinetic energy to the system as it's described in Statistical Mechanics. Here, the velocites are drawn from a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution, which is a Gaussian distribution with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 
        </p>
        <eq>$$ \sigma = \sqrt{\frac{kT}{m}}$$</eq>    
        

        <p>This is an approximation, which works fine as long as we are dealing with a low number of particles in a few dimensions.
            <br>
            Simulating the thermostat is done by setting the velocities at fixed intervals from the above-mentioned distribution and then using the Velocity Verlet method to .

        <h1>Exploration of potentials</h1>

        <p>
            In Figure 3, a potential is being sampled using molecular dynamics, that is, sampling using both a thermostat and the Velocity Verlet method. As is readily apparent, the low-energy molecules tend to stay constrained within their own local minimum, where the higher temperature molecules are more likely to spread out.

        <h1>Simulated Annealing</h1>

        <p>
            Simulated Annealing is a method of finding the global minimum of a potential energy function. It works by starting at a high temperature, which allows the system to search for many minima, and the gradually lowering the temperature, which makes the system more likely to stay in the global minimum.
