Fitted coefficients found using linear squars and uncertanties as the square root of the diagonal of the covariance matrix:
Fitted ln(A) = 4.95866 ± 0.0354019
Fitted lambda = 0.170624 ± 0.00715662
A = 142.404 ± 5.04136
Half-life: 4.06242 ± 0.170394 days
The modern value of the half-life of ThX (Ra-224) is 3.6316(14) d, which is not in agreement with the value found here.
The discrepancy is on the order of 2.5284σ.
